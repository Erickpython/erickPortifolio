                        <p>Read Connect is a grassroots literacy initiative I founded in 2024 to bridge the reading gap among learners in underserved communities across Kenya. Our mission is to empower students with essential reading skills through a free, accessible e-library and engaging learning tools. By fostering a culture of reading, Read Connect aims to unlock academic potential and lifelong opportunities—ensuring that every child, no matter their background, has the chance to thrive through literacy.</p>

                        <h3>Teach for Kenya Fellowship</h3>
                        <p>January 2024 - upto Date</p>
                        <p>I currently serve as a Fellow with Teach For Kenya, a leadership development program that places driven graduates and professionals in underserved public schools to tackle educational inequity. Through this two-year fellowship, I teach at Ngwata Primary and Junior School in Mlolongo, Machakos County, where I work to improve student outcomes while addressing deeper systemic challenges. Beyond the classroom, the fellowship equips me with training in education leadership, community engagement, and social innovation—empowering me to become a long-term advocate for quality education in Kenya.</p>

                        <h3>Industrial Attachment IMTR - KMD</h3>
                        <p>May 2022 - August 2022</p>
                        <p>In 2022, I undertook a professional industrial attachment at the Kenya Meteorological Department’s Institute for Meteorological Training and Research (IMTR), specifically within the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) Lab. Over the course of this attachment, I gained hands-on experience in accessing and interpreting satellite imagery, running weather forecasting models such as WRF and GFS, and working with model outputs to produce visual forecasts. I also developed skills in scripting, server navigation (SSH), and using tools like McIDAS for atmospheric data handling. This experience significantly enhanced my technical abilities in operational meteorology, data analysis, and climate forecasting—grounding me further in applied environmental science.</p>

                        <h3>South Eastern Kenya University</h3>
                        <p><strong>Bachelor of Science in Meteorology (2018 - 2022)</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Grade: First Class Honors</strong></p>
                        <p>I earned a First Class Honours degree in Meteorology, reflecting my strong commitment, discipline, and passion for understanding the Earth's atmosphere. My studies equipped me with a solid foundation in atmospheric science, weather forecasting, climate modeling, and data analysis. Throughout the program, I applied theoretical knowledge through practical fieldwork, use of forecasting tools, and satellite data interpretation. This academic journey not only strengthened my technical expertise in meteorological science but also prepared me to contribute meaningfully to climate resilience, disaster preparedness, environmental management, and data-driven decision-making for sustainable development.</p>
